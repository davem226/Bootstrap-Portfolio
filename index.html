                    Hi, I'm Dave and I'm an aspiring web developer. My path to this point has been perhaps a bit unusual. In college, I realized
                    that I love nature -- birds especially -- and majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
                    of Michigan. After earning my BS, I took the next step toward becoming a professor and earned an MS from
                    Auburn University, where I studied the evolution of bird genomes. As much as nature fascinates me, however, academia
                    irritates me, and through a lengthy and difficult process I decided I'm better off elsewhere. Though,
                    not a total loss, my experience in academia provided me a great deal of practice analyzing complex problems
                    and -- fortuitously -- coding.
                </p>
                <p id="p2">
                    After researching many new career options, I decided the satisfation I get from coding -- along with my general affinity
                    for abstract thinking, problem solving, and creativity -- pointed me toward the world of web development.
                    To this end, I have recently begun a six-month "coding bootcamp" at Case Western Reserve University in
                    Cleveland, OH. There, I aim to build my web development skills to where I can compete for entry-level
                    developer jobs upon completion of the program.
                </p>
                <p id="p3">
                    Outside of career aspirations, I love to bird (basically birdwatching, but a lot more fun), hike, play and watch a myriad
                    of sports, lift weights, think about how coding and nature can be combined, and learn about the world
                    in any way I can. Please take a look at my professional portfolio and feel free to contact me for any
                    reason. Thanks!
                </p>
